# Advice Generator App (Frontend Mentor)

This is a solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db).
Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

&#9745; View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size

&#9745; See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

&#9745; Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

### Extra features added

&#9745; Scripts using both the XMLHttpRequest object and the Fetch API.

&#9745; Disabled the button for the duration of caching to allow for better UX.

&#9745; Added loading animation to the button during its disabled period.

&#9745; Smooth transitions of advice text content.

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   SASS
-   7-1 SASS Architecture
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   XMLHttpRequest

### What I learned

-   This is the first project I have worked on involving external API's. I understand that the
    XMLHttpRequest object is a somewhat outdated solution to asynchronous data retrieval, but I
    wanted to understand how it all works from the ground up.

-   I learned about the `Cache-Control` HTTP headerfield and its corresponding `max-age` directive.

### Useful resources

-   [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) Cache-Control HTTP Header
